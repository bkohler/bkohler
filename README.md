# Hey there! I'm Benjamin Kohler 👋🏻

Tech enthusiast passionate about building software with Ruby, Python, and Shell scripting.

During the day, I'm navigating emails and PowerPoints, but I love diving into code to automate and innovate. Based in Zug, Switzerland, I run a lot in my free time to stay energized.
